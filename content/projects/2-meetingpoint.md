CCG Meetingpoint is a custom built platform for managing orders, menus, deliveries and payments.
It completely digitized all order-related processes for the CCG Meetingpoint restaurant, including an API for the cash register and a `Stripe` implementation.
While `React` is used as the client technology, the backend consists of a full serverless architecture running on `AWS`.
The software is running at the [CCG Meetingpoint](http://www.ccg-meetingpoint.at/) since Q1 2021.

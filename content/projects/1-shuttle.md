Shuttle is a real-time management software for cargo centers.
It covers a specific use case of containers that are transferred from rail to road transportation.
While *React* is used as the client technology, the backend consists of a full serverless architecture running on *AWS*.
Shuttle is running at the [Cargo Center Graz](http://www.cargo-center-graz.at/) since 2019 and has managed over 10k containers.

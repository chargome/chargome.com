[Paketrechner.at](http://www.paketrechner.at/) is a private platform for calculating parcel delivery prices all around the world. The platform takes destination, parcel dimensions with weight and outputs the internal price calculation of several carriers, including air freight.
While *React* is used as the client technology, the backend consists of a full serverless architecture running on *AWS*.
The software gets continously extended since 2021.
